## Description
**Gang of Four (GoF)** is how the authors of "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software " are often referred to.
A **design pattern** is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem. The idea was introduced by the architect ***Christopher Alexander*** and has been adapted for various other disciplines, notably software engineering.

This design patterns are the most used today, so in this project we will create examples of how all GoF design patterns can be implemented.
